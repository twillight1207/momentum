# Marvel Version Webpage
- hope there'd be enough time for me. Even after submission, I'll keep making my sexy page even more awesome.

### Further CSS works after class
- component: marvel color and font
- body: size and background-color
- header: clock & weather
- login form ~ input & greeting
- main div ~ grid
  - to-do input & list
  - two images on both side
  - quote on the bottom

### What I want to add more
- sexier font styles
- high quality of images
- flexible usage of icons (I failed..)
